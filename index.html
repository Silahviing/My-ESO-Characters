              <h3>Aldmeri Dominion</h3>
                <img src="images/aldmeri-dominion.png">
                <p>Aldmeri Dominion is a Faction in Elder Scrolls Online. When word reached the High Elves of Alinor that the Imperial City had fallen under the control of the human supporters of Molag Bal, the Aldmeri Dominion was formed. The High Elves reached out to the neighboring races of Wood Elves and Khajiit with a plea that their combined forces might prevent the younger races of Tamriel from bringing disaster to the world, as they had so many times in the past. The High Elves were the original settlers of Tamriel and created the common tongue used throughout the continent today. They are also naturally proficient with magic. The Wood Elves inhabit the thick, near-impenetrable forests of Valenwood. They are supreme hunters, guides, and masters in sneaking and thievery. They are also the most gifted archers in all of Tamriel. The Khajiit, a proud feline race, are fearsome warriors, proficient with bladed weapons. They stand proudly at the forefront of every battle. The power and determination of the Aldmeri Dominion should not be underestimated.</p>
              <h3>Ebonheart Pact</h3>
                <img src="images/ebonheart-pact.png">
                <p>Ebonheart Pact is a Faction in Elder Scrolls Online. Jorunn, of Eastern Skyrim, is acting High King of the Great Moot, but he does not rule absolutely. His decisions must be ratified by all three races in a unique form of governance called The Great Moot. He is down-to-earth, humorous, and has an iron will to succeed. <br>
                  "The alliance between our races was born in dark times, when Nord, Dunmer and free Argonians fought as one to repel the invasion of the Akaviri slavemasters. Our greatest strength is the adversity we have overcome. Our resolve is glacial, our might is forged in fire, and our courage, cultivated by the beasts of the jungle. We are Ebonheart. We are as one. And by this, our victory is assured."
                  Jorunn the Skald-King</p>
              <h3>Daggerfall Covenant</h3>
                <img src="images/daggerfall-covenant.png">
                <p>Daggerfall Covenant is a Faction in Elder Scrolls Online. The Daggerfall Covenant is a compact between the peoples of northwest Tamriel—Bretons, Redguards, and Orcs—that forms an alliance of mutual defense, with a vision of establishing peace and order across Tamriel. Indeed, the kings of the Covenant take the Remans as their model, claiming to be the spiritual heirs of the Second Empire. <br>
                  So this is the modern Daggerfall Covenant, an alliance of the Redguards of northern Hammerfell, under King Fahara'jad; the Orcs of the mountainous northeast, under King Kurog of Orsinium; with the Breton King Emeric of High Rock presiding from his palace in Wayrest. At its best, it is a noble alliance of honorable and chivalrous peoples, representing all the best aspects of the First and Second Empires. And from this solid foundation, perhaps a third, even mightier Empire shall arise, providing all the peoples of Tamriel the benefits of mutual respect, vigorous trade, and reverence for the Divines</p>

                  <h4>Altmer (High Elf)</h4>
                  <img src="images/ESOwiki_altmer_portrait.png">
                  <p>Starting Area: Khenarthi's Roost<br>
                    Racial Bonus: Altmer (High Elf) Racial Skills<br>
                    Suggested Classes: Sorcerer or Templar<br>
                    Strength: Magicka Builds<br>
                    <h5>Altmer (High Elf) Racial Skills</h5>
                    Altmer (High Elf) Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level. Players will continue to gain Racial Passives until they reach level 50, which where they will cap out the Skill Line. Each Race has their own set of Skills that make them unique and better suited for certain roles and Builds. Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    <h5>High Elf Racial Passives</h5>
                    Just looking at their Racial Passives, you can see that High Elves are more tuned towards the Magicka side of things, rather than Stamina. This means it is ideal to use them as either Magicka DPS or Healers, because they both take advantage of the Spell Damage and Max Magicka increase. These types of Builds use Staffs and are akin to “Mages” in other games, so if you wish to make a mage-like character, High Elf is a good choice.<br>
                    Additionally, they have an intriguing Passive in Spell Charge, which grants them 645 Stamina if they have higher Max Magicka and 645 Magicka if they have higher Max Stamina, every 6 seconds if they use a Class Ability. This is both good for PvP and for Tanking.<br>
                    In PvP, players will often CC you, forcing you to Break Free or die. Since this uses Stamina, and Magicka Builds usually have much lower Stamina pools, you will need all the Stamina you can get. And when Tanking, you will have more Stamina than Magicka, which allows you to gain Magicka every 6 seconds. You can use this Magicka for Damage Shields or other Skills that boost your surviveability, making it a valuable Passive.<br>
                    <h5>Best Builds for High Elves</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Magicka DPS: Excellent (Destruction Staff)</li>
                      <li>Stamina DPS: Not Good (Two-Handed Weapon, Dual Weapons, Bow)</li>

                  <h4>Bosmer (Wood Elf)</h4>
                  <img src="images/ESOwiki_bosmer_portrait.png">
                  <p>Starting Area: Khenarthi's Roost<br>
                    Racial Bonus: Bosmer (Wood Elf) Racial Skills<br>
                    Suggested Classes: Nightblade or Dragonknight<br>
                    Strength: Stamina and Stealth<br>
                    <h5>Bosmer (Wood Elf) Racial Skills</h5>
                    Bosmer (Wood Elf) Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level. Players will continue to gain Racial Passives until they reach level 50, which where they will cap out the Skill Line. Each Race has their own set of Skills that make them unique and better suited for certain roles and Builds. Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    <h5>Wood Elf Racial Passives</h5>
                    Looking over the Passives you can see that Wood Elves are more inclined to be Stamina-based characters, and ones that incorporate some amount of Stealth into their gameplay. This means they will use some combination of martial weapons like Bows, Swords and Daggers.<br>
                    Stealth is not particularly useful for PvE content outside of questing, but is useful in PvP. And though Max Stamina is good for Tanking, Stamina Recovery is not because Stamina Recovery ceases while Blocking, which Tanks do constantly. These bonuses place Wood Elves squarely into the Stamina DPS category, without much flexibility, if you’re looking to optimize.<br>
                    <h5>Best Builds for Wood Elf</h5>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Magicka DPS: Not Good (Destruction Staff)</li>

                      <li>Healer: Not Good (Restoration Staff)</li>
                      <li>Tank: Passable (One-Handed and Shield)</li>

Players will continue to gain Racial Passives until they reach level 50, which where they will cap out the Skill Line. Each Race has their own set of Skills that make them unique and better suited for certain roles and Builds. Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    Below is the list of the Current Passive skills, along with a new list of Proposed Passive skills that is expected to arrive for Update 21 Wrathstone in February of 2019.<br>
                    <h5>Khajiit Racial Passives</h5>
                    The Khajiit Racial Passives are a bit of mixed bag, and really facilitates any kind of play, though perhaps not quite as good as some other Races. Being harder to detect when Sneaking, and increased chance of Pickpocketing, marks the Khajit as a Stealthier character. This helps with some questing, stealing, and PvP. Consider selecting the Nightblade Class when choosing Khajit if you plan to PvP, the reduced detection range makes them much harder to find. Khajits also benefit from higher Critical Strike Chance because of their Crit Damage and Crit Healing bonus, so be sure to use gear that has this Stat.<br>

                    <h5>Nord Racial Passives</h5>
                    Nords are a very tough to kill, and should be considered by those that wish to Tank as their primary role, or for those that wish to PvP, as extra Physical and Spell Resistance goes a long way in both of these cases. The increased Ultimate generation is also ideal for both of these, since Ultimate abilities often determine the victor in Cyrodiil, and it can really improve your effectiveness in group content. Select this Race if you know you want to Tank.<br>

                    <h5>Breton Racial Passives</h5>
                    Bretons have a heavy focus on Magicka, and thus make very good Magicka-based DPS or Healers. The cost reduction of Magicka abilities, in combination with the Magicka Recovery gives them excellent sustain, allowing them to DPS or Heal longer before needing to use a Potion or Heavy Attack to regain Magicka. The Spell Resistance is also nice to have, as it helps keep them alive longer, particularly in PvP. If you know you want to play a Magicka Build, this Race is a fantastic choice.<br>

                    <h5>Orc Racial Passives</h5>
                    Orcs have a heavy focus on the use of Weapons, putting them square into the Stamina DPS category. Their extra Health and healing, also help should they decide to Tank or PvP. Their Sprint cost reduction and Movement Speed increase also help tremendously with PvP, where you need to Sprint often, and can help them catch their prey or escape if they find them self in a bad situation. Select this Race if you plan to PvP often, or know you want to Stamina DPS.<br>

                    Dunmer (Dark Elf) Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level.

                    <h5>Dunmer (Dark Elf) Racial Passives</h5>
                    The Dark Elves are an interesting Race because they are equally good as Stamina and Magicka roles, making them a great choice for those that are not certain just how they wish to play their character. In addition, they are ideal for those wishing to take the Vampirism Skill Line, as the extra Flame Resistance will help to offset some of their weakness to Fire-based attacks. Consider taking this Race if you can’t decide between Stamina or Magicka, or you know you want to be a Vampire.<br>

                    <h5>Argonian Racial Skills</h5>
                    Argonian Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level.

Each Race has their own set of Skills that make them unique and better suited for certain roles and Builds. Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    <h5>Argonian Racial Passives</h5>
                    Argonians used to be one of the worst Races in the game, but they have been one of the best for some time now, and they are the ideal Race to choose if you plan to be a Healer because of their increase to Healing Done. They also make very good Tanks because of their Health increase, and their ability to regain many resources when they consume a potion. These same Passives, also make them one of the best PvP Races in the game, since all of these things are useful in Cyrodiil, tanking or not.<br>
                    <h5>Best Builds for Argonians</h5>

                    <h5>Redguard Racial Skills</h5>
                    Redguard Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level. Players will continue to gain Racial Passives until they reach level 50, which where they will cap out the Skill Line. Each Race has their own set of Skills that make them unique and better suited for certain roles and Builds. Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    <h5>Redguard Racial Passives</h5>
                    Much like the Orcs, Redguards have a substantial focus on the use of Weapons, and have a reduced cost when using them. This combined with Max Stamina and Stamina restoration via attacks, makes them perfect for the Stamina DPS role or even a Tank. Additionally, the snare effectiveness reduction is excellent if you plan to Werewolf, as snares are really their Achilles heel. If you know you’ll be using Weapons and will be Stamina focused, seriously consider taking Redguard as your Race.<br>

                    <h5>Imperial Racial Skills</h5>
                    Imperial Racial Skills in Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) are gained as the player increases his or her Character Level.

Be sure to study these when planning your character, as they can make the difference between a good player and a great player.<br>
                    <h5>Imperial Racial Passives</h5>
                    Imperials make ideal tanks, not only because of their bonuses to Health and Stamina, but because they regain all 3 resources when they deal damage, and have cost reduction for all abilities. Tanks use both Stamina and Magicka quite regularly, and regaining them really helps out. Health is just an added bonus. These same qualities make them a decent choice for PvP as well, though not as good as some other Races.<br>

Their name is from the old Aldmeric tongue, and translates roughly into "our ancestors," referring to their role as the progenitors of mer and men. To the majority of cultures on Tamriel, the Aedra are revered as gods.<br>
                    As Oblivion is the night sky on Tamriel,[4] so the Aedra are considered by some to be the planets. The largest eight planets are considered by Imperial society to be the Divines, while the stars are the Magna Ge.<br>

Drastically different, culturally and physiologically, from men and mer, the Beastfolk possess different skeletal structures and metabolic processes (even amongst themselves). While rumors of interbreeding between beastfolk and other races exist, none have been proven.<br>
                    Beastfolk come in a variety of colors and body structures, and are not sub-species of the same proto-race like men and mer. Included in this category are the Khajiit and Argonians.<br>

                    Their body structure is much larger than the normal Cathay. They are described as being "Jaguar-Men" with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur, and having a whip like tail. The Cathay-raht are known to be very fast, agile and strong, and able to jump incredible heights and distances with great dexterity. One account describes them as being of the same size and speed as a werewolf.<br>

                  <h4>Daedra</h4>
                  <p>Daedra (singular: Daedroth)is the term for the entities who inhabit the realms of Oblivion in The Elder Scrolls. They are viewed variously as gods or demons by the inhabitants of Tamriel, although scholarly consensus discourages the use of the latter term. The most powerful of the Daedra are referred to as Daedric Princes or Daedra Lords, and rule over their own planes of Oblivion, which they shaped. Because they have no connection to Nirn, they cannot be permanently killed, only banished.<br>
                    Daedra can be summoned to Nirn through a variety of techniques,which forms the basis for much of the school of Conjuration magic.<br>
                    Various Daedra have, on several occasions, attempted to invade Nirn. The most infamous events of this type are the Planemeld and the Oblivion Crisis.<br>

                  <h4>Dragons</h4>
                  <p>Dragonkind (Dragon Language: plural D.svgO.svgV.svg Dov, singular D.svgO.svgV.svgAh.svg Dovah; Aldmeris/Ehlnofex: Aka, Ancient Nordic: drah-gkon), often called Dragons, Wyrm, and sometimes dov-rha are a race of Akaviri beings usually described as the immortal children of the "Dragon God of Time" Akatosh. They were once widespread in Tamriel and ruled over men during the Late Merethic Era up until the Dragon War. For the most part, they consider non-dov to be weak minded, and their spoken language can be articulated to cast powerful magic known as Dragon Shouts, originated from the power known as the Voice, inherent to all dragons and their kin, the Dragonborn. Such power was also bestowed upon mortals by the efforts of Kyne and Paarthurnax, rendering men (and especially Nords) capable of shouting, with enough training.<br>
                    After the Dragon War, dragons no longer ruled over men, and they began to decline in numbers, being hunted by groups such as the Blades. Dragons were widely believed to be nothing but a legend for much of the late history of men, until 4E 201, when they resurfaced in Skyrim with the return of the "World Eater" Alduin.<br>

                  <h4>Dreugh</h4>
                  <p>The Dreugh or Dreughs are a Tamrielic race of powerful aquatic creatures observed primarily in Morrowind (especially the Inner Sea), the Illiac Bay, the Abecean Sea, Black Marsh and Cyrodiil. They are often hunted for their wax and hide.
                    Once common throughout Vvardenfell, Ebonheart, and the surrounding waters, they have been driven into isolated pockets in more recent times. There is some doubt on whether they shouldn't be classified along with Argonians, for their semi-aquatic nature and "troglophiliac" humanoid form.<br>
                    According to legend, the Dreugh devolved from a much more intelligent and civilized race due to conflict with the Dunmer (who used their hides and wax), and powerful, tyrannic Dreugh kingdoms are reported by Mankar Camoran in his Mythic Dawn Commentaries, even going as far as to state they once ruled the world. That notion is explored in Vivec's lessons, where it is stated that, "when the dreughs ruled the world, the Daedroth Prince Molag Bal had been their chief." The sermon gives details of the form Bal took at the time, describing it as "spiny and armored and made for the sea."<br>
                    Additionally, tales of civilized Land Dreugh colonies (purported to have built stone cairn houses and structures) exist, which affirm that the species raised mudcrabs for sustenance, but no evidence of such behavior exists today.<br>
                    At some point, Nix-Hounds were used to hunt the Dreugh.<br>

                  <p>
                    The Dwemer (also referred to as the Dwarves, Deep-Elves, Deep Folk, Deep Ones, People of the Deep, or the under-Elves) were an ancient "Lost Race" of Mer who were remnants of the early Aldmer, and lived primarily in the region of Dwemereth.<br>
                    Mer used the term "Dwemer," roughly translated as "People of the Deep." The term also connoted "deep-delving," "profound," and "close-counseled." Men commonly refer to them as "Dwarves," in reference to the fables of the Giants seeing them as small.<br>
                    The Dwemer were an advanced race and civilization, in many respects far ahead of the other races and civilizations of their time. They are well known for their skill and revolutionary developments in technology, engineering, crafting methods, metalwork, stonework, architecture, city-planning, science, mathematics, magic, and the academic arts.<br>
                    The Dwemer are known for being the subjects of one of the greatest mysteries in all of Tamriel. In 1E 700, during the Battle of Red Mountain, for reasons still debated and under circumstances still under investigation, the Dwemer seemingly disappeared. It is still being debated who or what caused the Dwemer to disappear, as well as whether they disappeared all at once or over a long period of time.<br>

The Aedra and Daedra came to be once Lorkhan convinced/tricked the Original Spirits (et'Ada) to create Mundus. The Daedra are the et'Ada who did not take part in the creation of Mundus to retain their power. The Aedra are the et'Ada who remained during the creation of Mundus, thus giving away a significant amount of their power.<br>

                  Information on the Hist is scarce, as the Argonians do not readily share such information with others, and may even view such sharing as a betrayal of their race.<br>

                  They are described as being tiger-like cat folk, possibly similar in appearance to the Khajiit and Lilmothiit. It is suggested that they are similar to Khajiit in terms of body structure as a humanoid cat-like design, and in appearance with stripes in the place of spots. Their leader, Tosh Raka, is said to have transformed himself into a large orange and black dragon, but it is unknown how similar he looks compared to the regular dragons of Nirn.<br>

                  The Adabal-a reveals they consisted of several indigenous tribes in Cyrodiil, including the Kothringi, the Al-Gemha, Men-of-Ge, Al-Hared and Men-of-Ket. While Nedes are often considered a single race of man, it has been said that they are more accurately a wide panoply of extremely varied mannish cultures and tribes who eventually would become more united through interactions within Tamriel. The Imperial race can trace their roots to the Nedic people after they bred with the Atmorans.<br>
                  The most notable of Nedes is St. Alessia, who defeated the Ayleid forces which enslaved her people.<br>

In 1E 808, they arrived in the western region of Tamriel known as Volenfell, and soon conquered the land from the Orsimer and renamed it to Hammerfell. They also defeated the Nedes when their ships first crashed in Tamriel and battled Giant Goblins for territory. They later became known as the Redguards.<br>

                  Scamp are small and "not particularly intelligent," and thus don't need to worry about the inherent fear of more intelligent Daedra (such as Dremora). but recognized as agile combatants who delight in cruelty just as much as any of the larger and more powerful Daedra. They’re often summoned to perform simple tasks, and make good (if sometimes unruly) messengers and servants. They are able to launch fireballs from their hands and rain fire from the sky. They possess a language, but it is unknown, as the way they speak seems incomprehensible.<br>
                  Interestingly, the Daedric hound Barbas says he was previously a Scamp who made deals with Orcs, and a Redguard in another time. He explains that, "for now," he served as the hound of Clavicus Vile. Due to their association to Dagon, the Scamp are considered Bad Daedra (that is, those who defy the authority of Almsivi, the Tribunal's godhead) within the classification of lesser Daedra. Along with them stand other two races of Mehrunes Dagon's servants, the Clannfear and the Dremora.<br>

                  Over the eras, the Tang Mo have had to defend their nation from slavery attempts from all of the other nations of Akavir, especially from the Kamal.<br>
                  Recently, however, the Tang Mo have created an alliance with the Ka Po' Tun.<br>

                  <p>Tsaesci (pronounced Say-es-see or Say-chee) are a race of vampiric serpent folk and/or humans, hailing from the continent of Akavir. They originated from the Wandering Ehlnofey, just as the Atmorans and Yokudans did.<br>

                  <h4>Umbrielian</h4>
                  <p>Umbrielians are a race native to the flying city of Umbriel. Unlike the mortal races of Nirn, the Umbrielians are grown as worms in the sump. The Hist from Umbriel remember all the forms of life in the city, and they are able to reproduce the protoforms or little worms Umbrielians start as in the sump. The worms grow up into adult bodies, while the Ingenium supplies the required souls.<br>
                  Those born to be skraws tend and harvest the sump. With the arrival of Mere-Glim to the sump, the skraws were planned to be replaced by Argonian shaped Umbrielians. The Umbrielians take care of all the tasks in Umbriel, from taking care of the growing worms in the sump to attending the chefs in the kitchens.<br>

                  <h4>Xivilai</h4>
                  <p>The Xivilai are powerful Daedra that exist in the plane of Oblivion, capable of magic. They primarily utilize fireballs and summon Clannfear to their aid. It is best to dispose of a Xivilai before being overwhelmed by the Clannfear minions they are capable of summoning. Ideally, marksman or melee are effective defenses against them, as Xivilai have a relatively strong spell absorption bonus. They usually carry a powerful axe or sword, ranging from Dwarven to Daedric, depending on the Hero's level.<br>
                  They can sometimes be found in fellowships of two or three. The Xivilai are the strongest of the Daedra, being able to wield two-handed weapons in one hand.<br>

              <h3>How to pick you ESO class</h3>
              <p>All classes in ESO are viable in all roles, although some classes have an innate capacity for excellence in certain scenarios. Since all classes can equip any light / medium or heavy Armor Set, and upgrade the skill lines for any Weapon, Class Skills are the main differentiator for builds and roles.<br>
                When making a build, you will generally select to be
                <ul>
                  <li>Magicka (typically ranged heals or dps)</li>
                  <li>Stamina (melee or bows dps or tank) or</li>
                  <li>Healt (tanking) class</li>
                </ul>
                You could want to become a magicka tank, which becomes harder to accomplish and thus the class you select will determine your performance. The specific skill lines associated for every class are then the deciding factor when making your build. Make sure to also think of the right Races to match your desired bonuses.

              <h3>ESO Class Roles</h3>
              <p>These are some suggested roles / focus for the classes. These are subjective observations and players can make any class/role work, however we have looked at the most unique abilities of a class to determine what role that class is naturally more inclined to. Templars, for example, have powerful healing skills in their class line. Dragon Knights have high survivability so they are naturally tankier.

            <h4>Cyrodiil</h4>
              <p>Cyrodiil is the home of one of the four races of Men: the Imperials. It is located in the heart of the continent. It serves as the capital of the many Empires since the First Era. Cyrodiil is covered largely by forests in the interior; humid marshes south of the Lower Niben; vineyards and farmsteads surrounding County Skingrad; the rolling amber hills of the Gold Coast to the west; and jagged highlands and tundra of the Jerall and Valus Mountains to the north and east. The capital city, the Imperial City and White-Gold Tower, is located on the City Isle in the middle of Lake Rumare. It is the heart of the Imperial Empire and the seat of the Emperor's power and the Elder Council.<br>

            <h4>Morrowind</h4>
            <p>Formerly Resdayn, Morrowind is the home of the Dunmer (Dark Elves) and is located in the north-east corner of Tamriel. It consists of Mainland Morrowind, where the capital city of Mournhold is located, as well as the ruling political body therein, and the large isle of Vvardenfell where the volcano Red Mountain dominates the landscape. Vvardenfell in particular has a very diverse topography ranging from the marshes of the Sheogorad region and the dense tropical mushroom forests of the Ascadian Isles to the rolling, golden plains of the Grazelands and the choking dust, harsh winds, and ash storms of the volcanic Ashlands region which dominates the center of the island. Morrowind as a whole is famous for its unusual flora and fauna, in particular the giant insectoid and arthropodan life and towering fungal growths.<br>

            </p>
            <h4>Skyrim</h4>
            <p>The original home of Men in Tamriel, Skyrim is located in the frigid north of Tamriel, between Morrowind and High Rock, and is the home of the oldest race of men, the Nords. Skyrim is a rugged, harsh, and unforgiving place of snow-capped, jagged mountains and wind-blasted ice fields standing in contrast to the verdant forests of the Rift and Falkreath Hold. The Fourth Era saw a dramatic change to Skyrim's northern coast during The Great Collapse of Winterhold when the glacier on which the capital city was built shattered and fell into the sea, taking much of the city with it. The College of Winterhold was unharmed however, and this has fostered a great deal of anger, suspicion, and resentment between the local Nords and the College Mages who insist they had nothing to do with the Collapse. The fact that the Nords have continued to dwell here is testament to their resilience and fortitude.<br>

            <h4>Black Marsh</h4>
            <p>Called Argonia by its inhabitants, Black Marsh is home to the reptilian race of the Argonians. It is located in the south-eastern corner of Tamriel and is covered by vast, festering marshes, rainforests, waterways, and immense, impenetrable forests of Hist and mangrove trees. Due to the topography of the land, travel of any distance is difficult for seemingly anyone that isn't Argonian which is a definite factor as to why Black Marsh has never been successfully invaded or mapped. Many cities of Black Marsh, such as Gideon, were originally founded by the Ayleids. Little else is known about this mysterious and ill-documented place.<br>

            <h4>Elsweyr</h4>
            <p>Elsweyr is the home of the feline race of the Khajiit and is located in the south of Tamriel, between the Provinces of Cyrodiil and Valenwood. Elsweyr is, for the most part, a desert land with majestic, rolling dunescapes and sun-drenched dust plains in the interior and thick forests and jungle surrounding it along its borders with Cyrodiil and Valenwood, with the Tenmar Forest covering a large area in the south of the Province.<br>
              <img src="images/Elsweyrmap.jpg">
            </p>
            <h4>Valenwood</h4>
            <p>The ancestral homeland of the Bosmer (Wood Elves). It is located in the south-western corner of Tamriel, west of Elsweyr. Valenwood, as its name suggests, is a land covered, for the most part, by forests. The topography is hilly and the west coast is choked by seemingly endless mangrove forests and tropical rainforests. The largest Bosmer villages and cities are built high in the boughs of ancient migratory trees which have the ability to move the settlements, in their entirety, wherever they venture.<br>

            <h4>Summerset Isles</h4>
            <p>Located in the Abecean Sea, the Isles are the home of the Altmer (High Elves). The main Isle, called Summerset and home of the capital city of Alinor, and the smaller Isle of Auridon are verdant landscapes dotted with towns and cities of ancient mansions and enchanted towers, similar to those of the Telvanni mages of Vvardenfell, Morrowind. The Isles also include the island of Artaeum, home of the Psijic Order, and also used to be home to the Crystal Tower.<br>

            </p>
            <h4>Hammerfell</h4>
            <p>Hammerfell is the home of the Redguards, the fourth race of Men, who came to Tamriel after leaving their original homeland of Yokuda. Hammerfell has an arid climate and much of the Province is desert, namely the great Alik'r Desert in the west, with a few forests on the coast and provincial borders with grasslands dominating the south around the Cyrodiil border, and the Dragontail Mountains located along the border with Skyrim. One of the most notable cities in Hammerfell is Stros M'kai. Stros M'kai is famous for its orrery, which is the only known fully functional orrery outside the Imperial City, in Cyrodiil.<br>
              <img src="images/Hammerfellmap.jpg">
            </p>
            <h4>High Rock</h4>
            <p>Located in the north-west corner of the continent, west of Skyrim, the homeland of the third race of Men, the Bretons. High Rock is a land with a cool, calm climate and rolling hills covered in heather which flow to the foothills of the Wrothgarian Mountains and the plateaus of North Kambria. High Rock is a land that is no stranger to battle. The warlords of various Breton clans and houses have been at war on and off for thousands of years. Notable cities include Daggerfall and Wayrest. The Adamantine Tower sits on an island called Balfiera in Iliac Bay.<br>
              <img src="images/HighRockmap.jpg">
            </p>
            <h4>Orsinum</h4>
            <p>The home of Orsimer, more commonly called "Orcs," officially a territory or city-province and not currently recognized as an independent nation and therefore not shown on any modern official map, encompasses a small area in the Wrothgarian Mountains and Dragontail Mountains within the province of High Rock. A difficult environment to thrive in as much of the landscape lies above the tree line, there are few abundant resources aside from rock and metals that require mining. Its geography, however, make it a place easy to defend against skirmishes and invading armies. This is fitting as Orsinium is no stranger to conflict and bloodshed: this is exemplified in the ancient conflict which resulted in Orsinium's "birth" and the ascension of the Orsimer's king Gortwog gro-Nagorm in the Third Era who rediscovered the ancient location and reclaimed it for the Orcs of Tamriel.<br>
